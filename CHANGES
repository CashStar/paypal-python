Changes introduced with each version.

1.1.0
-----
This version addresses compatibility with the newer versions of the PayPal API
by backing off on pre-query validation. PayPal's API error messages are
the safest bet, as bad as they can be at times.

Lots of cleanup, commenting, and creature comforts abound. Backwards-incompatible
changes are prefixed with 'BIC'.

* BIC: Removed the KEY_ERROR setting. Less complexity is better. (gtaylor)
* BIC: The 'token' position argument to do_express_checkout_payment
  is no a keyword arg, for the sake of consistency. (gtaylor)
* Adding lots of logging, which users may attach to for debugging. (gtaylor)
* Removed RESPONSE_KEYERROR. Wasn't being used. (gtaylor)
* Removed DEBUG_LEVEL setting. Use Python logging. (gtaylor)
* Removed some of the error checking on input values, as this
  limits users to the old API versions. We'll have to rely
  on PayPal's error messages being informative. (gtaylor)
* Bumped the default API version protocol to 72.0, up from 53.0. (gtaylor)

1.0.3
-----
* Python 2.5 compatibility. (Manik)

1.0.2
-----
* Documentation updates. (gtaylor)
* We now distribute with a copy of the Apache License. (gtaylor)

1.0.1
-----
* Misc. more specific imports to avoid import errors. (grigouze)
* Fixes to country test suite. (grigouze)
* Added a countries module that has all of the countries PayPal supports. (gtaylor)
